# Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe app written in C# with a graphical user interface (WinForms) which is played with a mouse. Opening the app leads to the main menu where the user may play with a friend locally or against the computer (which picks moves randomly according to which tiles are available). The user may also play on a board of sizes varying from 4x4 to 10x10 squares. The game's goal is not to score a row, column, or diagonal of your respective symbol (X or O). The first player who does, loses. Otherwise, it's a tie. When the game finishes, the player is prompted whether they would like to play again or not. Choosing "Yes" starts another round, while keeping scores for the players. Choosing "No" closes the application.
